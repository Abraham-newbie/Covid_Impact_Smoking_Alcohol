This repository contains the code to generate all plots and regressions. To run the coding scripts, first move the confidential data files of the LISS data files into the raw data folder as given below.


1. Liss Health Surveys (2018 to 2021)  in `raw-data/health-surveys`
2. Covid-19 Impact Lab Data from https://covid-19-impact-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets.html  in `raw-data/covid_impact`
3. Cleaned background data from https://liss-data-management-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/# in `raw-data/liss_cleaned_data`
4. Cleaned Time use and Consumption data from https://liss-data-management-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/# in `raw-data/liss_cleaned_data`




The order of execution of the scripts is as numbered, within the folders: 


1.  `data_cleaning`:

This folder contains the script files that clean the LISS surveys to generate clean data sets for anaalysis.

2.  `data_visualization`

This folder contains both conditional and unconditional plots using the cleaned LISS data.

3.  `data_analysis`


This folder contains the scripts that generate the tables and other regression analysis in the submission.
